# surveys - Isomorphic React.js, Socket.io and Express responsive surveys app [in development]
Building Isomorphic React.js app to learn React.

I'm using [git-flow branching models](http://danielkummer.github.io/git-flow-cheatsheet/) so all stable code lives in **develop branch** until release.

## App's UI

You can already [see what app's UI looks like on Wiki](https://github.com/Zzzlaya/surveys/wiki).

## If you can't wait to check it out now
1. Clone the repo: `git clone git@github.com:Zzzlaya/surveys.git`

2. Go into the app folder: `cd surveys`

3. Switch into the 'develop' branch: `git checkout origin/develop`

4. Install dependencies: `npm install` 

5. Start the app: `npm run start`

6. Open the browser and type: `http://localhost:8080`

7. Explore the app!

## Current tech stack
React, Express, Socket.io, Swig templates, Browserify (going to replace with Webpack)
